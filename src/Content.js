extremely unsatisfying and confusing to use.`;
export const paragraph1 = `A complete lack of microinteractions and contextual help resulted in a very stressful and frustrating experience. Users didn’t feel confident taking actions due to the complete lack of interface feedback. They often felt that taking action resulted in no outcome at all.

Another thing that contributed to poor UX was application UI design that only emphasized the impression of using an app in its early alpha stage rather than a finished and mature service. 

It made the whole application feel unreliable and faulty. From the business point of view, it resulted in a high user drop off rate.`;

shift product identity.`;
export const paragraph2 = `Keeping Aesthetic-Usability Effect in mind, redesigning UI became a top priority in order to make the application feel like a finished and carefully thought-out product.

Combining it with strong emphasis on contextual help and user-interface feedback loop, would without a doubt solve above-mentioned issues, and improve application’s overall user experience.`;

Impact of UI/UX Redesign`;
export const paragraph3 = `After implementing the solutions outlined above, user feedback showed a clear improvement in their experience with the application. Users reported feeling more confident and in control when taking actions, thanks to the addition of microinteractions and contextual help. 

They also appreciated the cleaner and more consistent design, which made the application feel more reliable and trustworthy. As a result, user drop-off rates decreased and a user’s trust has been restored, indicating that the implemented solutions had a positive impact on the application's overall usability and user experience.`;
