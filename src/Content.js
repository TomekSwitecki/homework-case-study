The application's infantile art direction, combined with a very raw and flawed UX, gave the impression of an app in its early alpha stage rather than a finished and mature service. The product identity adjustment was a much needed change in order to make the application feel like a finished and carefully thought-out product.`;

Last but certainly not least, establishing trust with your consumers takes designing a robust website. The appearance and usability of a site can make or break the user experience. A website that appears outdated takes too long to load does not have enough white space, or commits another web design faux pas is a red flag for the modern user. One study even found that 44 percent of site visitors will bounce if the company does not include its phone number or other contact information.`
