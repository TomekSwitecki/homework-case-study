extremely unsatisfying and confusing to use.`;

It made the whole application feel unreliable and faulty.";

The application's infantile art direction, combined with a very raw and flawed UX, gave the impression of an app in its early alpha stage rather than a finished and mature service. The product identity adjustment was a much needed change in order to make the application feel like a finished and carefully thought-out product.`;

export const IntroSection_Paragraph=`Homework.com is an application that <em>aims to make remote education as frictionless as possible</em> for both students and teachers. Classes and tasks can created with ease by faculty member. Students can submit their task’s solutions, and teachers can download them. 
Everything within one <em>user-friendly application</em>, eliminating the burdensome process of gathering submissions through email. 

<em>Unfortunatelly that wasn’t the case with application’s old UI/UX.</em>

The main <em>goal of this project</em> was to improve both its user interface and user experience with the restriction of adding as few new features as possible in a limited amount of time. In other words, the goal was to <em>significantly improve the user experience with limited time and resources.</em>`;
